					Let your imagination be your guide. We'll do another happy little planet sale. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the planet sales manager. The interdimensional fau gra is your friend. Preserve it. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. It's a very cold planet, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death.

					Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share the planet with a friend. Everyone needs a planet and a friend. Planets are the most valuable things in the galaxy. Give him a planet, we forget that we have our BOGO planet sale going on.

					These little son of a gun planets hide in your galaxy and you just have to push them out. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than buying a Millennium Falcon. At least you get a marginal return on investment when you buy our planets.
